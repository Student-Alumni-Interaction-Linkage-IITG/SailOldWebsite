                                        <p>A lot of the memories I have of my IIT Guwahati experience involve the countless hours I spent in the TV Room watching sports (mostly Cricket). My love for the sport grew by leaps and bounds during the 4 years I spent there. Everyone in IIT is fortunate to have experienced at least one Cricket World Cup during their time there. I particularly envy those who experienced the 2011 WC, as I am sure it must have been fantabulous...</p>

Even though I had eventually managed to grab the ‘Institute Silver Medal’ for having aggregated the highest CPI in my department, I was never really inclined towards doing an MS or a PhD. I was quite clear then, and am glad that I am clear about it now as well... </p>

                                        <p>Prior to starting the PhD, I was working with Proctor and Gamble for two years trying to improve and optimize numerically FMCG packaging processes with focus on finite element (FEM) modeling of their Injection Stretch Blow Moulding (ISBM) process. It was during this time I obtained my Masters degree (MPhil), which was sponsored by P&G in 2010, and I spent most of my time in Belfast, UK...</p>

                                        <p>IITs are great institutions and IITG adheres to that legacy. The exposure at IITs is exceptional. All throughout the semester, one is bogged down by the numerous assignments, excruciating labs, quizzes, mid-semesters, end-semesters, etc. In addition to that, we have Alcheringa, Inter IIT, Techniche and Manthan. Over and above we have our own space for movies and friends (boys and girls both).What I have learnt out of all this is to optimize...</p>

                                        <p>The experiences in IIT shaped my personality in various ways. The embarrassment in Electronics lab assignments taught me to keep trying. Managing Infrastructure team in Techniche and Mr. & Miss Alcheringa team in Alcheringa contributed towards time and people management. The academics provided me the fundamental knowledge of my field and CGPA highlighted the importance of achieving objectives...</p>

                                        <p>My first story is that of Tarun Jain. The first time I met him was at a drama club audition. A goofy young boy with intelligent eyes. If you saw him in a group, he would mostly be blending in. But as I got to know more about him, he was an ocean of a personality.I have met a lot of dog lovers, cat lovers and even bird lovers. But for the first time in my life, I had come across someone who loved all kinds of animals from turtles to mice...</p>

                                        <p>“Hey Nishit. Can we get you on a plane to Chennai? We want to work with you on an Amazon Prime web series we are creating with AR Rahman!”</br>
                                            As he sat on the flight to Chennai, Nishit’s heart was racing. When he set out on this journey a few years back, he imagined a lot of plane rides, but never one leading to this. “Rahman, I am coming,” he smiled to himself as he sat back and let his life flash back in his mind...</p>
